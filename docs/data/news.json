      "title": "Show HN: OverType – A Markdown WYSIWYG editor that's just a textarea",
      "url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44932651",
      "summary": "<p>Hi HN! I got so frustrated with modern WYSIWYG editors that I started to play around with building my own.<p>The problem I had was simple: I wanted a low-tech way to type styled text, but I didn't want to load a complex 500KB library, especially if I was going to initialize it dozens of times on the same page.<p>Markdown in a plain <textarea> was the best alternative to a full WYSIWYG, but its main drawback is how ugly it looks without any formatting. I can handle it, but my clients certainly can't.<p>I went down the ContentEditable rabbit hole for a few years, but always came to realize others had solved it better than I ever could.<p>I kept coming back to this problem: why can't I have a simple, performant, beautiful markdown editor? The best solution I ever saw was Ghost's split-screen editor: markdown on the left, preview on the right, with synchronized scrolling.<p>Then, about a year ago, an idea popped into my head: what if we layered a preview pane behind a <textarea>? If we aligned them perfectly, then even though you were only editing plain text, it would look and feel like you were editing rich text!<p>Of course, there would be downsides: you'd have to use a monospace font, all content would have to have the same font size, and all the markdown markup would have to be displayed in the final preview.<p>But those were tradeoffs I could live with.<p>Anyways, version 1 didn't go so well... it turns out it's harder to keep a textarea and a rendered preview in alignment than I thought. Here's what I discovered:<p>- Lists were hard to align - bullet points threw off character alignment. Solved with HTML entities (• for bullets) that maintain monospace width<p>- Not all monospace fonts are truly monospace - bold and italic text can have different widths even in \"monospace\" fonts, breaking the perfect overlay<p>- Embedding was a nightmare - any inherited CSS from parent pages (margin, padding, line-height) would shift alignment. Even a 1px shift completely broke the illusion<p>The solution was obsessive normalization:<p><pre><code>    // The entire trick: a transparent textarea over a preview div\n    layerElements(textarea, preview)\n    applyIdenticalSpacing(textarea, preview)\n\n    // Make textarea invisible but keep the cursor\n    textarea.style.background = 'transparent'\n    textarea.style.color = 'transparent'\n    textarea.style.caretColor = 'black'\n\n    // Keep them in sync\n    textarea.addEventListener('input', () => {\n      preview.innerHTML = parseMarkdown(textarea.value)\n      syncScroll(textarea, preview)\n    })\n</code></pre>\nA week ago I started playing with version 2 and discovered GitHub's  element, which handles markdown formatting in a plain <textarea> really well.<p>That experiment turned into OverType (<a href=\"https://overtype.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://overtype.dev</a>), which I'm showing to you today -- it's a rich markdown editor that's really just a <textarea>. The key insight was that once you solve the alignment challenges, you get everything native textareas provide for free: undo/redo, mobile keyboard, accessibility, and native performance.<p>So far it works surprisingly well across browsers and mobile. I get performant rich text editing in one small package (45KB total). It's kind of a dumb idea, but it works! I'm planning to use it in all my projects and I'd like to keep it simple and minimal.<p>I would love it if you would kick the tires and let me know what you think of it. Happy editing!<p>---<p>Demo & docs: <a href=\"https://overtype.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://overtype.dev</a><p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/panphora/overtype\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/panphora/overtype</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44932651\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44932651</a></p>\n<p>Points: 230</p>\n<p># Comments: 66</p>",

It’s available today to all users, including free accounts.<p>We’re curious how the HN community feels about this.
